# Profile summary

The hotel business thrives on understanding customer preferences and booking patterns to optimize operations and revenue. This case study focuses on analyzing data from two types of hotels to extract insights into their historical and current business performance. The goal is to provide actionable recommendations for improving profitability and customer satisfaction.

I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, patterns, and anomalies in the hotel booking dataset. Starting with raw data cleaning and preprocessing, I ensured the dataset was ready for analysis by removing inconsistencies and noise. Key areas of focus included:

Analysis of booking volumes over time. Identifying the demographic and behavioral traits of customers. Examining price distribution across different booking scenarios. Studying the duration of stay and its correlation with booking preferences. Insights into arrival and checkout trends. Key findings from the analysis include:

The highest number of bookings occurred in 2016, with August being the busiest month for both 2016 and 2017. The most popular meal plan among customers was BB (Bed and Breakfast). An optimal stay duration of 5 days ensures the best daily rate for customers. A high rate of booking cancellations was observed, highlighting a need for strategies to reduce cancellations. Full Board (FB) meal options require improvement to better cater to customers staying for extended durations. The visualizations, interactive plots, and detailed analysis presented here aim to help hotel owners understand their business better and implement strategies to attract more customers while retaining existing ones.

# Business objective

When planning vacations, business trips, or casual getaways to a new city, hotel bookings are an essential part of the process, and everyone seeks to optimize their stay. For some, optimization means securing a great deal at a lower price, while for others, it could be booking a luxurious suite in a 7-star hotel during a non-peak period.

Using the Hotel Booking dataset, which contains tabular data on guest booking patterns, stay durations, meal preferences, and more over a year, we aim to conduct an in-depth analysis to uncover key insights and predict trends. Personally, I prioritize avoiding random price surges and prefer paying a fair, optimized rate for my stay. Additionally, ensuring a safe vacation with my loved ones is crucial, so I would favor hotels with fewer crowds and robust health and safety measures.

The objective of our analysis is twofold: to assist potential guests in making informed decisions about the ideal hotel, stay duration, and other preferences, and to provide actionable insights for hotel management to enhance their services and better cater to guest needs.

# Conclusion

City Hotel holds the largest share of bookings, with 73% of reservations not being canceled. Resort Hotel tends to attract more families and guests with children. However, City Hotel experiences higher cancellation rates, possibly due to their no-deposit and no-cancellation-charge policies.

2016 saw the highest number of bookings across both hotels, with August being the peak month for guest arrivals. Additionally, guests tend to prefer weekday stays over weekends.

City Resort can be branded as "Duo/Couple-Friendly" and "Children-Friendly," while Resort Hotel is more suitable for families with babies. Both hotels have relatively few repeat guests.

City Hotel guests typically stay for 2 or 3 days, while Resort Hotel guests often stay for 1 or 7 days. City Hotel guests account for 64% of total special requests, compared to Resort Hotel's 36%. City Hotel also offers more "No Deposit" bookings, although Resort Hotel has a higher percentage of no-deposit bookings overall.

The price range and standard deviation for City Hotel are lower than Resort Hotel, with Resort Hotel prices exceeding City Hotel rates in peak months like July, August, September, and June. For the remaining months, City Hotel maintains higher prices than Resort Hotel.
