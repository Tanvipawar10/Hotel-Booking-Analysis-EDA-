        "To achieve the business objectives, the hotel management should focus on several key strategies. Resort hotels, with fewer bookings than city hotels, should consider offering packages and promotions to boost bookings. This could include creating attractive deals to draw in more customers and make the resort more appealing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regarding food preferences, since BB (Bed and Breakfast) is the most popular choice, it’s crucial for the hotel to maintain its quality. At the same time, they can offer discounts on other types of meals to encourage guests to explore different options. This would not only relieve pressure on the kitchen but also provide variety to customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data shows that repeat bookings are low, so it’s important to find ways to increase return guests. The hotel can achieve this by offering incentives for repeat bookings, marketing tailored offers based on past guest preferences, and understanding the motivations behind those who return. By targeting this group, the hotel can turn occasional guests into loyal customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "In terms of guest composition, both city and resort hotels see many couples booking stays, so promoting group and family bookings could be a great strategy. Special discounts for family or group reservations can help maximize occupancy and revenue, as well as cater to those looking for more space or amenities suitable for larger groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data also shows that guests tend to stay longer at city hotels, with most staying for two or three nights, while resort guests typically stay for one or seven nights. Resort hotels can capitalize on this by offering promotions for middle-range stays, encouraging longer visits without overwhelming guests with extended durations.\n",
        "\n",
        "A key observation is that weekday bookings outnumber weekend stays. By introducing special weekday promotions or discounted rates, hotels can drive bookings during these quieter periods, thus increasing revenue throughout the week.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, understanding guest demographics is vital. Families with children seem to prefer city hotels, while couples and families with babies may lean toward resort accommodations. Hotels should cater to these preferences by highlighting specific amenities for each group, such as family-friendly rooms or romantic getaway packages.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, promoting advance deposits is essential for both hotels. This approach helps secure revenue faster, reduces cancellations, and minimizes the risk of no-shows. With guests increasingly avoiding pre-deposit bookings, encouraging this practice can help improve financial stability and reduce potential losses.\n",
